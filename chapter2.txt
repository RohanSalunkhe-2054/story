I’ve been collecting and using them since 2004.

And one thing I’ve learned is this:

The most effective and inspiring quotes are the shortest.

For example, one of the quotes I’ve repeated the most in my head is “stay hungry, stay foolish” by Steve Jobs.

It’s only 4 words long.

But it’s packed with wisdom and power.

The best part?

It’s a practical quote you can apply in your life.

Like most quotes you’ll find here.
